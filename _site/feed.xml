        <title>I scream for ice-cream</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt; 

I was deciding what my next post should be about and was scrolling through my photos. I did not realize how many ice cream places I visited, nor did I realize how many strong opinions I formed on each place. Ice cream is the best thing ever, and I&#39;ve cultivated a list of the places I tried and which one tops the list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/amplehills.JPG&quot; style=&quot;width:400px;height:500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
(1) Best. Ice Cream. Ever. I did not Yelp Ample Hills, nor did I know it even existed. I was on my way to the High Line, and as I was walking through the Meatpacking District, I saw this ice cream shop very busy. I didn&#39;t think much of it and continued to walk towards the High Line. But it was hot. Really hot. So as I walked down the High Line, and through Chelsea Market, I kept my eyes open for any other somewhat appetizing looking ice cream place, but nothing stood out to me like Ample Hills. So, of course, I decided to wait and try it on my way back home. I&#39;m so glad I made the decision - I&#39;ve never had such good strawberry ice cream. In my life. It literally had fresh strawberries in it, and though I chose the less healthy route, I felt like I was eating real strawberries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/iceandvice.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Ice and Vice&quot; style=&quot;width:500px;height:300px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
(2) Carded for Ice Cream. Ice and Vice was pretty good. Actually, it was really good, but it just didn&#39;t stand out or taste out of the ordinary. I, did, however, like it because of its unique flavors. I wanted to try the &lt;i&gt;Coffee and Champagne&lt;/i&gt; flavor, but the employees needed to see ID (isn&#39;t that so funny?). Since I&#39;m such a huge rebel, I asked my sister to get the flavor for me in a plain vanilla cone (don&#39;t tell anyone) and then I ate it at the back of the store. It was delicious. My sister, on the other hand, got the Black Tea, &lt;i&gt;Lemon Charcoal Flavor&lt;/i&gt; in a &lt;i&gt;Moscow Mule&lt;/i&gt; cone. And my sister&#39;s friend got a scoop of &lt;i&gt; Hot Cheeto Ramen &lt;/i&gt; and a scoop of &lt;i&gt;Lobster Crouton ice cream &lt;/i&gt; in a blue corn and honey cone. By far the most interesting flavor, but I was, to be honest, a little scared to try those flavors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/rename.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;More Ice Cream&quot; style=&quot;width:400px;height:500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
(3) Vegan. Van Leeuwen Artisan Ice Cream was my least favorite shop. I&#39;ve lately started liking Mint Chocolate Chip, and my sister and I decided to split the &lt;i&gt; Vegan Milk Chocolate Chip &lt;/i&gt;. I think it was a cool experience to try vegan ice cream, but I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of that particular ice cream. My experience with ice cream in NYC told me that New Yorkers love exoctic ice cream, especially unique flavors that they&#39;ve never tried before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/chobani.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Chobani&quot; style=&quot;width:400px;height:500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
(*Bonus*) This doesn&#39;t count as ice cream, but one day we were in SoHo and stopped at the Chobani store for a snack. My family loves greek yogurt, and my sister and I sort of freaked out that there was a store that served greek yogurt like we were at an ice cream shop. We literally got to order a cup of yogurt with whatever toppings we wanted - I got the option with raspberries, granola, and honey, while my sister got the one with blueberries, walnuts, agave nectar, and chia, pumpkin, and sunflower seeds. Stopping at the Chobani store was so cool and different from anything I&#39;ve seen in California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Visiting the MoMa</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/MoMa.JPG&quot; style=&quot;width:400px;height:500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt; 

I visited a couple different museums in NYC, but the MoMa, unexpectedly, turned out to be my favorite. Yet I&#39;ve never liked museums. No matter how much energy I have before, nor how full I am, as soon as I enter any museum, I start to yawn and complain about how hungry I am. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;But guess what? I surprised myself. I didn&#39;t even think (at least mostly) about being hungry. I definitely didn&#39;t think about sleep. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Fascinated by the impressionist art, I continued to walk through the gallery, admiring lesser known van Gogh paintings. I completely forgot that the &lt;b&gt;original&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Starry Night&lt;/i&gt; is in the NYC MoMa. I&#39;m actually almost glad I did - I was completely in awe of the painting. Seeing something in real life, versus in pictures and books, is an entirely different experience. Below is one of my other favorite van Gogh paintings (&lt;i&gt;Olive Trees&lt;/i&gt;): &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/vangogh.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;van Gogh&quot; style=&quot;width:400px;height:500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph-center&quot;&gt;It was also really amazing to get to see artwork by artists that I learned about in my French class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/chagall.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Marc Chagall&quot; style=&quot;width:400px;height:500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph-center&quot;&gt;Marc Chagall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/degas.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;degas&quot; style=&quot;width:400px;height:500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph-center&quot;&gt;Edgar Degas&#39; paintings had so much texture and depth, and I loved the fact that he used dancers to emulate Parisian life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph-center&quot;&gt;I also got to see work by Andy Warhol:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/warhol.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;warhol&quot; style=&quot;width:400px;height:500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph-center&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gold Marilyn Monroe&lt;/i&gt; -- Warhol used an actual piece of film tape to capture this image of Marilyn Monroe. His work is absolutely inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Vegetarian Bean Burgers Recipe</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/Burger.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Vegetarian Burger&quot; style=&quot;width:300px;height:400px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt; 
&lt;b&gt;Servings: 4 &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

1 1/2 red onion&lt;br /&gt;
1/3 cup frozen peas&lt;br /&gt;
1/3 cup frozen corn&lt;br /&gt;
1 green pepper&lt;br /&gt;
2 peeled carrot sticks&lt;br /&gt;
1 jalapeno&lt;br /&gt;
1 clove garlic&lt;br /&gt;
1 can black beans&lt;br /&gt;
1/2 cup bread crumbs&lt;br /&gt;
1 tomato&lt;br /&gt;
1 Handful of salad leaves&lt;br /&gt;
4 whole wheat burger buns&lt;br /&gt;
1/3 cup hummus&lt;br /&gt;
Salt, cayenne to taste&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Recipe:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To begin with, dice one red onion and mince the clove of garlic. Chop the green pepper, carrots, and jalapeno as well, and drain, rinse, and dry the can of black beans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Pour two tablespoons of olive oil into a pan, and cook the diced red onion and minced garlic on medium heat for a couple of minutes. Once browned, add the peas, corn, pepper, and jalapeno, stir the vegetables and add salt and cayenne pepper to taste. Add another tablespoon of olive oil, and let the veggies cook for a few minutes on medium heat. Then, add the entire can of beans and let the beans and veggies cook for another two minutes. Remove the pan from heat and mix in the bread crumbs. Mash the entire mixture so that the beans create a paste and are not whole. At this time, if the mixture is falling apart, add more bread crumbs until you can create four balls out of the bean mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Once the bean and veggie mixture is ready, seperate it into four sections and create four patties with your hands. Grill the four patties on medium heat until both sides of the patty are brown. Once one side is completely grilled and the other side is not, place a slice of cheese on the finished side and allow the patty to finish grilling. Also grill the burger buns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 

Once the patties and buns are done, spread hummus on all of the burger bun tops and place the salad leaves on the bottom of the buns. Then, slice the tomato and half onion to top the patties. 
 &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/Picnic.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Picnic Picture&quot; style=&quot;width:400px;height:400px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt; This blog has been in the works for a few weeks now, and I&#39;m so excited to finally share it with all of you! The last six weeks have been a really fun time for me - I was in the heart of New York City, exploring, eating (hence the frequent recipes/food reviews you will see on this blog), and learning. This first post is a little more general, but over the next few posts, I&#39;m going to share with you some of my favorite adventures/discoveries :) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

This is a picture of a picnic that my sister and I packed. That Sunday, we actually went on a lot of mini adventures - before going to Central Park for our picnic, we took the subway to a famous grocery store, Zabar, known for its eight years of existence and specialty groceries. After our picnic (and a little nap), we visited a cafe, Cafe Lalo, famed for being featured in &quot;You&#39;ve Got Mail.&quot; We, of course, went back home and watched the movie (turns out Zabar was also featured in the movie!). Overall, it was a fun day, and I&#39;m excited to share some other stories with you all over the course of the next few weeks! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

My trip to NYC was, more than a trip, a learning experience. I learned so many things that I&#39;ve never had to before - how to use public transportation every day (something we in the Bay Area don&#39;t have to really worry about), become more responsible, and go out of my comfort zone - there were some days that I was hesitant to go places because I was afraid I would get lost in such an ovewhelming city. But I also realized it was a unique opportunity for me. I&#39;ve never really liked museums, but NYC has SO many unique museums and exhibitions that I now love them. I got to see some of my favorite artists, something I wouldn&#39;t have gotten the chance to do otherwise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I&#39;m going to share more detailed stories with you from my trip, so come back in a few days! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Love, &lt;br /&gt;
Avanti

&lt;/p&gt;
