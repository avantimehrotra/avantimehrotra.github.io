<p class="paragraph"> 

I visited a couple different museums in NYC, but the MoMa, unexpectedly, turned out to be my favorite. Yet I've never liked museums. No matter how much energy I have before, nor how full I am, as soon as I enter any museum, I start to yawn and complain about how hungry I am. <br>

<br>But guess what? I surprised myself. I didn't even think (at least mostly) about being hungry. I definitely didn't think about sleep. <br><br>

Fascinated by the impressionist art, I continued to walk through the gallery, admiring lesser known van Gogh paintings. I completely forgot that the <b>original</b> <i>Starry Night</i> is in the NYC MoMa. I'm actually almost glad I did - I was completely in awe of the painting. Seeing something in real life, versus in pictures and books, is an entirely different experience. Below is one of my other favorite van Gogh paintings (<i>Olive Trees</i>): <br><br></p>

<p class="paragraph-center">It was also really amazing to get to see artwork by artists that I learned about in my French class:</p>

<p class="paragraph-center">Edgar Degas' paintings had so much texture and depth, and I loved the fact that he used dancers to emulate Parisian life.</p> <br>

<p class="paragraph-center">I also got to see work by Andy Warhol:</p>

<p class="paragraph-center"><i>Gold Marilyn Monroe</i> -- Warhol used an actual piece of film tape to capture this image of Marilyn Monroe. His work is absolutely inspiring.</p>
