<b>Servings: 4 </b> <br><br>
<b>Ingredients:</b><br>

1 1/2 red onion<br>
1/3 cup frozen peas<br>
1/3 cup frozen corn<br>
1 green pepper<br>
2 peeled carrot sticks<br>
1 jalapeno<br>
1 clove garlic<br>
1 can black beans<br>
1/2 cup bread crumbs<br>
1 tomato<br>
Handful of salad leaves<br>
4 whole weat burger buns<br>
1/3 cup hummus<br>
Salt, cayenne to taste<br><br>

<b>Recipe:</b><br>
To begin with, dice one red onion and mince the clove of garlic. Chop the green pepper, carrots, and jalapeno as well, and drain, rinse, and dry the can of black beans.<br><br>

Pour two tablespoons of olive oil into a pan, and cook the diced red onion and minced garlic on medium heat for a couple of minutes. Once browned, add the peas, corn, pepper, and jalapeno, stir the vegetables and add salt and cayenne pepper to taste. Add another tablespoon of olive oil, and let the veggies cook for a few minutes on medium heat. Then, add the entire can of beans and let the beans and veggies cook for another two minutes. Remove the pan from heat and mix in the bread crumbs. Mash the entire mixture so that the beans create a paste and are not whole. At this time, if the mixture is falling apart, add more bread crumbs until you can create four balls out of the bean mixture.<br><br>

Once the bean and veggie mixture is ready, seperate it into four sections and create four patties with your hands. Grill the four patties on medium heat until both sides of the patty are brown. Once one side is completely grilled and the other side is not, place a slice of cheese on the finished side and allow the patty to finish grilling. Also grill the burger buns.<br><br> 

Once the patties and buns are done, spread hummus on all of the burger bun tops and place the salad leaves on the bottom of the buns. Then, slice the tomato and half onion to top the patties.
