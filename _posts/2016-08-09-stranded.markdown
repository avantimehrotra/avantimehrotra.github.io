<p class="paragraph"> 
One of my most memorable memories of my trip to NYC was when my sister and I went to her friend's wedding. We took the subway to Grand Central Station, from where we would take a train to get to Conneticut, which is where the wedding was taking place. As you can see in the picture above, Grand Central looks like an image straight out of a fantasy. </p>

<p class="paragraph"> Just as we entered Conneticut, our train stopped abruptly, and we were forced to get off of the train and wait for an unspecified amount of time. After over an hour of waiting, we were told that the bridge our train needed to cross was experiencing mechanical issues. As a result, we were forced to find other forms of transportation to get to our destination, and since so many of us were stranded, Uber surge prices soared, and finding an available taxi was difficult. Literally stranded in the outskirts of Conneticut, my sister and I panicked. Luckily, however, some of our very close family friends live in Conneticut and were ultimately able to give us a ride to the venue. Driving through Conneticut actually turned out to be a pretty neat experience. Although we got to the hotel, which is also where the reception was, much later than expected because of the train, we still got to attend a majority of the reception (and catch the second half of the Warriors semifinals game). </p>

<p class="paragraph"> Above is a picture of a beautiful church on the outskirts of Conneticut. We passed the church as we were driving away from the station with our family friend. To be honest, I was surprised how calm (relatively) we stayed throughout the entire situation - part of it, of course, for me was that my sister was also there. But despite how hot it was, and how much confusion there was in the span of a few hours, it was actually an entertaining experience: we got to drive through suburban Conneticut, as well as the wooded areas, and see parts of another state, one very different from the New York I had just somewhat adjusted to. </p>
