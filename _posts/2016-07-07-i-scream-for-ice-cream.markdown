I was deciding what my next post should be about and was scrolling through my photos. I did not realize how many ice cream places I visited, nor did I realize how many strong opinions I formed on each place. Ice cream is the best thing ever, and I've cultivated a list of the places I tried and which one tops the list. </p><br>

(1) Best. Ice Cream. Ever. I did not Yelp Ample Hills, nor did I know it even existed. I was on my way to the High Line, and as I was walking through the Meatpacking District, I saw this ice cream shop very busy. I didn't think much of it and continued to walk towards the High Line. But it was hot. Really hot. So as I walked down the High Line, and through Chelsea Market, I kept my eyes open for any other somewhat appetizing looking ice cream place, but nothing stood out to me like Ample Hills. So, of course, I decided to wait and try it on my way back home. I'm so glad I made the decision - I've never had such good strawberry ice cream. In my life. It literally had fresh strawberries in it, and though I chose the less healthy route, I felt like I was eating real strawberries. </p><br>

(2) Carded for Ice Cream. Ice and Vice was pretty good. Actually, it was really good, but it just didn't stand out or taste out of the ordinary. I, did, however, like it because of its unique flavors. I wanted to try the <i>Coffee and Champagne</i> flavor, but the employees needed to see ID (isn't that so funny?). Since I'm such a huge rebel, I asked my sister to get the flavor for me in a plain vanilla cone (don't tell anyone) and then I ate it at the back of the store. It was delicious. My sister, on the other hand, got the Black Tea, <i>Lemon Charcoal Flavor</i> in a <i>Moscow Mule</i> cone. And my sister's friend got a scoop of <i> Hot Cheeto Ramen </i> and a scoop of <i>Lobster Crouton ice cream </i> in a blue corn and honey cone. By far the most interesting flavor, but I was, to be honest, a little scared to try those flavors. </p><br>

(3) Vegan. Van Leeuwen Artisan Ice Cream was my least favorite shop. I've lately started liking Mint Chocolate Chip, and my sister and I decided to split the <i> Vegan Milk Chocolate Chip </i>. I think it was a cool experience to try vegan ice cream, but I wasn't a huge fan of that particular ice cream. My experience with ice cream in NYC told me that New Yorkers love exoctic ice cream, especially unique flavors that they've never tried before. </p><br>

(*Bonus*) This doesn't count as ice cream, but one day we were in SoHo and stopped at the Chobani store for a snack. My family loves greek yogurt, and my sister and I sort of freaked out that there was a store that served greek yogurt like we were at an ice cream shop. We literally got to order a cup of yogurt with whatever toppings we wanted - I got the option with raspberries, granola, and honey, while my sister got the one with blueberries, walnuts, agave nectar, and chia, pumpkin, and sunflower seeds. Stopping at the Chobani store was so cool and different from anything I've seen in California. </p> <br>
