As I was looking through my photos to decide on my next post, I realized I had visited a ton of ice cream places. What I didn't realize was how many strong opinions I had formed on each place. Ice cream is the best thing ever, and I've cultivated a list of the places I tried and which one tops the list. </p><br>

(1) Best. Ice Cream. Ever. I did not <i>Yelp</i> Ample Hills, nor did I know it even existed. I was on my way to the High Line, and as I was walking through the Meatpacking District, I saw Ample Hills was very busy. I didn't think much of it and continued to walk towards the High Line. But it was hot. Really hot. So as I walked down the High Line, and through Chelsea Market, I kept my eyes open for another appealing ice cream place, but nothing stood out to me like Ample Hills. So, of course, I decided to wait and try it on my way back home. I'm so glad I made the decision - I've never had such good strawberry ice cream. In my life. It literally had fresh strawberries in it, and though I chose the less healthy route, I felt like I was eating real strawberries. </p><br>

(2) Carded for Ice Cream. Ice and Vice was pretty good. Actually, it was really good, but it just didn't stand out or taste out of the ordinary. I, did, however, like it because of its unique flavors. I wanted to try the <i>Coffee and Champagne</i> flavor, but the employees needed to see ID (isn't that so funny?). Since I'm such a huge rebel, I asked my sister to get the flavor for me (shh...don't tell anyone) in a plain vanilla cone. It was delicious. My sister, on the other hand, got the Black Tea, <i>Lemon Charcoal Flavor</i> in a <i>Moscow Mule</i> cone. And my sister's friend got a scoop of <i> Hot Cheeto Ramen </i> and a scoop of <i>Lobster Crouton ice cream </i> in a blue corn and honey cone. By far the most interesting flavor, but I was, to be honest, a little scared to try those flavors. </p><br>

(3) Vegan. Van Leeuwen Artisan Ice Cream was my least favorite shop. I've started liking Mint Chocolate Chip, and my sister and I decided to split the <i> Vegan Milk Chocolate Chip </i> flavor that day. I think it was a cool experience to try vegan ice cream, but I wasn't a huge fan of that particular ice cream. My experience with ice cream in general in NYC told me that New Yorkers love exoctic ice cream. </p><br>

(*Bonus*) This doesn't count as ice cream, but one day we were in SoHo and stopped at the Chobani store for a snack. My family loves greek yogurt, and my sister and I sort of freaked out that there was a store that served greek yogurt like an ice cream shop. We literally got to order a cup of yogurt with whatever toppings we wanted - I got the option with raspberries, granola, and honey, while my sister got the one with blueberries, walnuts, agave nectar, and chia, pumpkin, and sunflower seeds. Stopping at the Chobani store was so cool and different from anything I've ever seen in California. </p> <br>
